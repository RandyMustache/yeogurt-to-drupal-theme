#What is this?
The scaffold used to create Drupal theme using Yeogurt

#What to do next?
Steps to consider:
1. My preference for directory structure is /docroot (for the drupal code), /prototype (for the yeogurt stuff)
2. Configure your theme path in configurations.json
3. Copy or Rename credentials.blank.json to credentials.json
4. Don't forget to run [npm install]
